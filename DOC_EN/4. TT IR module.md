```
    The infrared remote control sends out a series of binary pulse codes. In order to avoid interference from other infrared signals during wireless transmission, it is usually first modulated on a specific carrier frequency, and then transmitted by infrared emitting diode, while infrared receiving device needs to filter out other clutter, only receiving the signal of the specific frequency and restore it to binary pulse code, that is, demodulation.

    The sensor is inserted directly into the TT IO expansion board through the PH2.0-3P digital cable. The product is packed with PH2.0-3P and easy to connect.
