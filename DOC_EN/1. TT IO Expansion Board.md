    TT IO expansion board is specially designed for TT open source controller, can be used for expanding GPIO | IIC | as well as 2*7P interface of TT drone, and a MOS drive circuit is added in GPIO14 pin to facilitate the drive of laser/motor and other power devices.

    The expansion board has three sets of PH2.0-3P GPIO interface, one set of PH2.0-4P I2C interface, and a MOS circuit driven by IO 14, which can connect the sensors with the PH2.0 interface and correct line order for expansion.
